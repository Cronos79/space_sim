SPACE SIM
Universe Design Constitution (v0.1)
1. Core Principle: The Universe Is Alive

The universe exists and evolves independently of player presence.

AI factions:

wage wars

expand territory

lose territory

thrive economically

collapse or be destroyed

All of this happens with or without real players online.
Players are participants in an ongoing simulation, not the center of it.

There is no “paused world,” no reset, and no guaranteed player relevance.

2. Scale of Power: Factions vs Players

AI factions operate on a solar-system scale.

A faction may control:

entire solar systems

planetary cities

moon outposts

jump gates

major trade routes

A player can eventually control a solar system, but:

it takes a very long time

it requires immense resources

it requires defeating or displacing a faction-level power

it is expected to be extremely rare

Typical Player Power

multiple space stations

mining bases on planets and moons

localized trade influence

control of a small corner of space

Players matter locally long before they matter globally.

3. Territory and Movement
Solar Systems

Each solar system contains:

planets

moons

asteroid belts

orbital space

potential jump gates

Ownership and control of these locations can change over time.

Stargates

Fixed structures in space

Connect specific solar systems

Allow small and medium ships to travel between systems

High traffic, strategic choke points

Extremely valuable to control

Difficult to hold due to constant pressure

Controlling a jump gate is one of the most powerful strategic positions in the universe.

FTL Travel

Large ships may use independent FTL drives

Slower than gate travel

Expensive and resource-intensive

Used for:

exploration

warfare

deep-space logistics

This creates natural space geography:

gates = trade highways

FTL = long-range strategic movement

4. Player Influence

Players start small and insignificant.

Over time, players can:

influence trade routes

manipulate local economies

engage in diplomacy (directly or indirectly)

affect relationships between AI factions

destabilize regions through piracy, war, or trade dominance

Early on, players do not matter globally.
Late game, players may become regional powers.

5. Destruction and Loss

The universe is destructive and permanent.

Players can:

destroy AI space stations

destroy player-owned space stations

destroy moon and planetary bases

raid ships and steal cargo

lose everything if defeated

There is no guaranteed safety.

Loss is part of the universe’s history.

6. Player Assets and Ownership

Players are limited in what they can permanently own.

Players May Own:

space stations

mining bases on planets

mining bases on moons

fleets of ships

Players May NOT Own:

planetary cities

full planets

faction capitals (without replacing the faction itself)

Ownership emphasizes infrastructure, not population governance.

7. Stations, Planets, and Moons

Stations, planets, and moons have different starting sizes and limits.

Space Stations

Primary player base

Modular construction

Limited number of addon slots (example: 4 at start)

Possible addons:

hangar bays

cargo storage

power plants

manufacturing modules

defense systems

Stations must be upgraded over time to expand capacity.

Planetary and Moon Bases

Focused on resource extraction or specialized production

Smaller and more limited than stations

Vulnerable to attack

Require logistical support from stations

8. Economy and Industry

The economy is material-based and layered.

Raw Resources

mined from asteroids, planets, moons

Refined Materials

ores → bars

bars → components

Examples:

steel bars

steel plates

wiring

tubes

glass panes

advanced components

Usage

Materials are required for:

station upgrades

addons

ships

repairs

trade

Industry is not abstracted away — logistics and production matter.

9. Ships and Fleets

Players may own and operate multiple ship types:

cargo ships (trade)

mining ships (resource gathering)

warships (defense and offense)

Ships are:

expensive

destructible

persistent

critical to expansion and survival

Fleets project power beyond the station itself.

10. Conflict, Trade, and Piracy

The universe supports multiple interaction styles:

peaceful trade

diplomacy

piracy

territorial warfare

Pirates (AI or player-aligned):

attack ships

disrupt trade routes

create instability

Players may:

hunt pirates for profit

become pirates

exploit chaos for economic gain

Security is never guaranteed.

11. Time and Simulation

The universe runs on real-time ticks.

Time scale:

~1 real hour = ~1.5 in-game days

~1 real day = ~1 in-game month

This allows:

long-term wars

economic cycles

meaningful absence

historical change

The universe remembers.

Design Summary

The universe is the protagonist.

Players are small actors in a massive simulation.

AI factions shape history.

Power is slow, costly, and fragile.

Trade routes and gates define strategic geography.

Loss is permanent and meaningful.

Story emerges from simulation, not scripts.
