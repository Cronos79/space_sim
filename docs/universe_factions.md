# Space Sim — Universe Factions Design (v0.1)

## Purpose

Factions are the primary drivers of history in the universe.

They:
- expand and contract territory
- wage wars
- form and break alliances
- control trade routes
- rise, stagnate, and collapse

Players exist *within* this system, not above it.

---

## Core Principle

Factions act independently of player presence.

If no players exist:
- factions still trade
- factions still fight
- factions still expand or decline
- the universe still changes

Players influence factions, but do not replace the need for them.

---

## Faction Types

### Major Factions
- Approximate count: **5**
- Control:
  - multiple solar systems (usually 2–3 core systems)
  - planetary cities
  - moons, outposts, and stations
  - jump gate regions
- Define:
  - borders
  - large-scale wars
  - economic stability

Major factions are extremely difficult to defeat outright.

---

### Minor Factions
- Control:
  - a single solar system
  - or individual planets/moons
- Often exist in:
  - frontier regions
  - border zones
  - unstable systems
- Can:
  - grow into major factions
  - be absorbed
  - collapse or fragment

Minor factions create political texture and opportunity.

---

### Outlaw and Pirate Groups
- Do not control systems formally
- Operate from:
  - dead systems
  - asteroid belts
  - hidden bases
- Disrupt:
  - trade routes
  - faction borders
- Can grow stronger if unchecked

Outlaw activity reflects local instability.

---

### Dead / Unclaimed Systems
- No governing faction
- May contain:
  - abandoned infrastructure
  - valuable resources
  - ancient or derelict structures
- High-risk, high-reward zones
- Often contested indirectly by factions

These systems are fertile ground for player influence.

---

## Faction Attributes

Each faction is defined by high-level traits, not micromanagement.

Core attributes include:
- temperament (peaceful, neutral, aggressive)
- economic focus (trade, industry, military, extraction)
- expansion tendency (static, opportunistic, expansionist)
- risk tolerance
- diplomatic bias

These traits guide AI behavior consistently over time.

---

## Territory and Control

### Solar System Control
A faction may:
- fully control a system
- partially control key bodies within a system
- contest control with rivals

Control is based on:
- infrastructure presence
- military strength
- logistics and supply
- stability

Ownership can change over time.

---

### Jump Gate Influence
Jump gates are critical strategic assets.

Factions may:
- secure gates militarily
- patrol routes
- tax or regulate traffic
- fight prolonged conflicts over gate systems

Gate control often defines borders.

---

## Expansion and Decline

Factions expand by:
- colonizing unclaimed systems
- absorbing minor factions
- conquering rivals
- establishing trade dominance

Factions decline due to:
- economic collapse
- prolonged war
- internal instability
- loss of trade routes
- sustained piracy

No faction is immortal.

---

## Warfare

- Wars are strategic and long-term
- Territory changes slowly
- Core systems are heavily defended
- Frontier systems change hands frequently

Wars may:
- begin over resources
- be triggered by trade disruption
- escalate from border skirmishes
- end in stalemates rather than annihilation

Total faction destruction is rare and historical.

---

## Diplomacy

Factions may:
- form alliances
- establish trade agreements
- maintain neutrality
- declare war
- manipulate proxy conflicts

Diplomacy is dynamic and influenced by:
- geography
- economics
- recent events
- player actions

Players may indirectly affect diplomatic outcomes.

---

## Economy and Logistics

Factions rely on:
- trade routes
- resource flow
- industrial capacity

Loss of logistics weakens:
- military response
- economic growth
- territorial control

Trade routes are as important as fleets.

---

## Player Interaction with Factions

Players:
- start politically insignificant
- operate within faction space or frontier zones
- may trade with factions
- may raid or sabotage faction assets
- may act as mercenaries or intermediaries

Over time, players can:
- influence local policy
- destabilize regions
- support or undermine factions
- become regional powers

Players rarely replace factions outright.

---

## Destruction and Permanence

Faction assets are persistent and destructible:
- stations
- fleets
- outposts
- planetary bases

Loss is permanent.

Faction history is shaped by destruction and recovery.

---

## Design Guarantees

- Factions act without player input
- No faction is scripted to win
- Borders are unstable over long timeframes
- Geography shapes politics
- Power requires logistics and control, not just force

---

## Design Intent Summary

Factions are the engines of history.

They:
- give meaning to territory
- create conflict without quests
- provide scale beyond the player
- ensure the universe feels alive

Players do not save the universe.
They survive, adapt, and occasionally reshape it.
