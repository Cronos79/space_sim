# Space Sim — Trade and Logistics Design (v0.1)

## Purpose

This document defines how trade and logistics function in the universe.

Trade is not a background system.
Logistics is not flavor.

Together, they are the **primary source of power** for factions and players.

Wars are decided by logistics.
Empires rise and fall on trade routes.

---

## Core Principle

**Value is created by movement, not possession.**

Resources have little meaning until they are:
- moved
- protected
- delivered
- consumed

Trade and logistics create risk, opportunity, and conflict.

---

## Trade Is a Process, Not an Action

Trade is not:
- a button
- an instant exchange
- a guaranteed profit

Trade is:
- continuous
- time-based
- exposed to disruption

Profit is earned over time, not instantly claimed.

---

## Logistics as Power

Logistics defines:
- how far influence extends
- how fast forces can react
- how resilient an economy is

A faction or player without logistics cannot:
- sustain fleets
- defend territory
- maintain industry

Logistics failure precedes collapse.

---

## Trade Routes

### Definition
A trade route is a **persistent flow of goods** between locations.

Routes may connect:
- stations
- planets
- moons
- faction hubs
- markets

Routes operate continuously over time.

---

### Route Properties
Each trade route has:
- distance (jumps / travel time)
- throughput capacity
- risk level
- operating cost
- expected profit margin

Longer routes are:
- more profitable
- more dangerous
- harder to protect

---

## Geography Matters

Trade routes are shaped by:
- stargate layout
- chokepoints
- faction borders
- piracy density

Routes that pass through:
- single-gate systems
- frontier regions
- contested space

…are high-risk, high-reward.

Safe routes are stable but less profitable.

---

## Trade and Time

Trade generates value **per tick**, not per interaction.

- Ships move over time
- Goods arrive over time
- Profit accumulates over time

Disruptions:
- delay delivery
- reduce profit
- cause losses

Trade rewards planning, not attention.

---

## Ships and Trade Capacity

Trade requires ships.

### Cargo Ships
- finite cargo capacity
- require fuel, crew, maintenance
- vulnerable to attack

Larger ships:
- move more goods
- are slower
- are harder to replace

Smaller ships:
- are faster
- are easier to lose
- suit risky routes

There is no universally optimal ship.

---

## Risk and Piracy

Trade routes are never perfectly safe.

Risk increases with:
- distance
- low security
- political instability
- lack of patrols

Piracy:
- disrupts routes
- destroys ships
- steals cargo
- destabilizes regions

Unchecked piracy reshapes trade geography.

---

## Protection and Control

Trade routes can be protected by:
- escorts
- patrols
- faction security
- diplomacy

Protection:
- costs resources
- reduces profit margins
- increases stability

Control of key routes is a major strategic objective.

---

## Trade vs Production

Production without logistics is useless.

- Mining produces raw resources
- Industry refines materials
- Trade moves value to where it matters

Overproduction without distribution:
- crashes local value
- creates bottlenecks
- wastes time and effort

Balanced logistics enable growth.

---

## Faction Trade Behavior

AI factions:
- establish trade routes automatically
- reroute around danger
- compete over profitable paths
- fight to protect key corridors

Faction wars often begin as **logistics conflicts**.

---

## Player Interaction with Trade

Players may:
- establish their own trade routes
- disrupt faction trade
- protect routes for profit
- exploit shortages
- act as smugglers or intermediaries

Early players influence **local trade**.
Late players influence **regional trade**.

Players rarely dominate global trade alone.

---

## Trade Collapse and Recovery

Trade routes can fail due to:
- sustained piracy
- war
- loss of infrastructure
- political collapse

When trade collapses:
- prices spike
- shortages appear
- unrest increases
- power shifts

Recovery takes time.

There are no instant fixes.

---

## Logistics and Warfare

Wars strain logistics first.

- fleets consume supplies
- ship losses must be replaced
- long campaigns require stable trade

A faction that loses its trade routes:
- fights weaker
- reacts slower
- collapses internally

Destroying logistics is often more effective than direct conquest.

---

## Design Guarantees

- Trade requires time
- Logistics always impose cost
- Risk cannot be eliminated
- Geography defines opportunity
- Power flows through routes, not stockpiles

---

## Design Intent Summary

Trade and logistics are the bloodstream of the universe.

They:
- connect systems
- create conflict
- reward foresight
- punish neglect

Those who move value shape history.

Those who cannot are shaped by it.
