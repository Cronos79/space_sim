# Space Sim — Station Philosophy (v0.1)

## Purpose

Space stations are the primary player-owned assets.

This document defines **what stations are**, **what they are not**, and the rules that prevent them from becoming:
- clicker mechanics
- infinite expansion engines
- passive income generators with no risk

Stations are meant to be **strategic commitments**, not UI toys.

---

## Core Principle

A station is a **long-term infrastructure decision**, not a temporary build.

- Stations take time to build
- Stations take effort to maintain
- Stations expose the player to risk
- Stations shape how the player interacts with the universe

More stations do not automatically mean more power.

---

## What a Station Represents

A station represents:
- industrial capacity
- logistical reach
- political presence
- vulnerability

Stations are **anchors** in space, not cities and not ships.

---

## Hard Limits (Anti-Clicker Rules)

### Slot-Based Expansion
Stations have a **limited number of addon slots**.

- Initial stations start small (example: 4 slots)
- Slots are finite and meaningful
- Adding slots requires major upgrades, not trivial actions

This forces choice.

---

### No Infinite Scaling
Stations cannot scale infinitely.

- Production is capped by:
  - slot count
  - power availability
  - logistics throughput
- Adding more of the same module yields diminishing returns

There is no “best layout.”

---

### No Instant Actions
Nothing on a station happens instantly.

- Construction takes real time
- Upgrades take real time
- Repairs take real time

Time is the primary cost.

---

## Station Roles (Specialization)

Stations are designed to **specialize**, not generalize.

A station may focus on:
- trade and logistics
- mining and refining
- manufacturing
- defense and military support
- frontier operations

Trying to do everything results in inefficiency.

Specialization creates:
- interdependence
- trade demand
- vulnerability

---

## Addons and Modules

### Addons
Addons are **structural commitments**.

Examples:
- hangar bays
- cargo storage
- power plants
- manufacturing lines
- defensive systems

Addons:
- consume power
- require maintenance
- increase station profile (visibility and threat)

Every addon has a cost beyond materials.

---

### Modules Are Not Buttons
Modules:
- run continuously
- consume inputs over time
- produce outputs over time
- can be disrupted

They are not activated repeatedly for reward.

---

## Power, Throughput, and Constraint

Stations are governed by **constraint systems**, not raw numbers.

Key constraints:
- power generation
- cargo throughput
- ship capacity
- maintenance capability

Exceeding constraints causes:
- inefficiency
- downtime
- breakdowns

Constraint management is gameplay.

---

## Logistics Dependence

Stations do not exist in isolation.

They require:
- regular supply
- functional trade routes
- ship support

A station cut off from logistics:
- slows
- degrades
- becomes vulnerable

Isolation is dangerous.

---

## Vulnerability and Risk

Stations are persistent and destructible.

- They can be attacked
- They can be blockaded
- They can be destroyed

Defensive investment reduces risk but never eliminates it.

Absolute safety does not exist.

---

## Maintenance and Decay

Stations require upkeep over time.

- Maintenance costs scale with complexity
- Neglected stations degrade
- Damaged stations require time and materials to recover

Overextension leads to collapse.

---

## Player Growth Philosophy

Player growth comes from:
- planning
- specialization
- logistics mastery
- risk management

Not from:
- repetitive clicking
- stacking bonuses
- idle accumulation

Stations reward **foresight**, not attention.

---

## Multiple Stations

Players may own multiple stations.

This increases:
- logistical complexity
- maintenance burden
- political visibility

More stations:
- multiply problems
- multiply risk
- do not multiply power linearly

Expansion must be deliberate.

---

## Early vs Late Game Stations

### Early Game
- small
- fragile
- highly specialized
- dependent on others

### Late Game
- robust
- expensive
- politically relevant
- strategically valuable

Growth is gradual and earned.

---

## Design Guarantees

- Stations enforce choice
- Time is always a cost
- Power requires maintenance
- Logistics matter more than raw output
- No station is ever “finished”

---

## Design Intent Summary

Stations are not factories to be optimized endlessly.

They are:
- commitments
- liabilities
- strategic anchors

A well-run station survives.
A poorly planned station fails.

The universe does not forgive waste.
